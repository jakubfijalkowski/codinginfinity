## Hi

My name is Jakub Fijałkowski, for some known as *Fiołek*. I'm a programmer that, currently, is getting his master's degree at [Warsaw University of Technology]. I code, read and do things. I [did some projects] that I'm quit [proud of]. I'm in constant search for a better library, better technology, better everything.

My journey started with PHP (that were sad times), then focused on .NET and C#. Now I'm getting my hands dirty with Haskell and I love it. I'll probably be learning something new any time now, so this may get outdated really fast. ;)
