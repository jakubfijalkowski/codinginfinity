It was a matter of time when I will start my new blog. This time with new brand, completely different [backend] and with different language. I hope I will persist a little bit longer than last time, but I make no promises here.

## The name

I thought that having something different than *FioÅ‚ek* as a name of blog will be cool. I struggled for a long time to find appropriate name, but failed. Then, when reading about [F-Algebras], the name came in a flash. So what does the "Coding Infinity" actually mean? [Oxford Dictionary] states, that *infinity* is:

> A point in space or time that is or seems infinitely distant.

And *coding* is just a synonym for *programming*, which is defined as

> The process of writing computer programs.

Setting maths and logic aside, my definition of *coding infinity* is

> The process of writing computer programs that change a point in space or time that is infinitely distant.

Or in other words - creating impossible. ;)

### Old blog

The old blog [still lives], but the oldest one is currently unavailable (if I find time to do it, it will be available at something like <http://old2.fiolek.org> ).
